### Overview
　　RaaMLab is a free and open-source MATLAB toolbox that is to generate amino acid groupings using amino acids' properties and classification methods, and further extract the structural and physicochemical features of reduced amino acids. It offers four kinds of databases on physico-chemical properties of amino acids and amino acid groupings, 49 amino acid classification methods, and five kinds of biophyscio-chemical features of reduced amino acids including content-based features, correlation-based features, order-based features, position-based features and pseudo-reduced amino acid compositions, which can be easily computed based on the amino acid groupings with the user-defined alphabet size and amino acids' properties.</br>
　　The RaaMLab Toolbox requires at least MATLAB Release 7. No compilation is required and the use of MATLAB as a basis allows the toolbox to be used on Windows, Linux, Unix and MAC OS machines. The installation of the toolbox consists of unpacking a compressed file to the desired location and run setup function. More conveniently, the output from the AA-Index module could be directly used as the user-defined property to calculate the aforementioned descriptors, greatly enlarging the applications to our calculated features.</br>
